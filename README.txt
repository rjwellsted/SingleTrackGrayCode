This is the design for a single track gray code encoder disc and sensors.

This design uses 6 sensors giving 2^6-2*6 (52) unique patterns which yeilds a positional accuracy of approximately 7 degrees (i.e. +/- 3.5 degrees)

This was designed in OpenSCAD for the weather station project for the wind direction instrument.
